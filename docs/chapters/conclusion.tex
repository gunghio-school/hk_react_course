\chapter*{Conclusion}
This document summarizes the major and most important topics covered during these two courses. Within each course, there were exercises and assignments that were performed and completed and are freely available at this address: \url{https://github.com/gunghio-school/hk_react_course.git}

In addition, a personal project covering most of the topics was carried out in parallel.
It is a web app for booking articles for a butcher shop. The web app was developed using Next.js, a framework that combines frontend in React and backend in Node in a single application, and relies on a database in MongoDB.

The webapp can be accessed at \url{carne.gunghio.ch} after authentication using username \textit{neggio} and password \textit{matur}, while its source code is available at the following address: \url{https://github.com/OlmoBarberis/food-gunghio.git}.
